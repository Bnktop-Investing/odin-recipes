        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Lebanese, a Palestinian, a Syrian and an Israelite gather around the table. They leave out political questions. Today they just want to 
        talk about food, specifically a simple, modest, but essential dish on any Middle Eastern table: hummus, which consists of a cream of
        cooked chickpea puree to which lemon and tahine (sesame paste) are added. or sesame). Its origin dates back to the thirteenth century
        although the chickpea was already known three thousand years before Christ, century up century down. The four diners have thought
        that a relaxed meal sharing the same plate can bring positions closer on the issue that is being debated: who was the first who
        created hummus. They will not reach the desserts because the copyright of this culinary invention is under discussion precisely 
        between Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians and Israelis and so it is difficult to reach a consensus. Regardless of who is right, we 
        suggest you make this hummus, a good way to get in touch with the cuisine of that region of the world that, unfortunately, is not 
        always news for its gastronomy.</p>

            <li>
                If tahine is not available, it can be made easily at home: in a frying pan without any oil,
                add three tablespoons of sesame and lightly toast it very carefully so that it does not burn
                <strong>(it will be ready in about 5 minutes)</strong>. Blend with olive oil until you get a thick paste.
